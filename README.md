====

A toolbox of a GitHub organization's contributor community.

Try at: http://publiclab.github.io/community-toolbox


## Embed an issues list

Community Toolbox lets you view issues of a specific repository for embedding on another site, with the following URL:

https://publiclab.github.io/community-toolbox/examples/embed.html#o=orgname&r=repository

For issues with a specific label, use, for example: 

https://publiclab.github.io/community-toolbox/examples/embed.html#o=orgname&r=repository&l=first-timers-only

To embed these on your site, use an `<iframe>` like this:

```html
<iframe src="https://publiclab.github.io/community-toolbox/examples/embed.html#o=orgname&r=repository" style="border:none;" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
```


## Developing

To develop and build out Community Toolbox, you'l need to have `npm` installed and to run `npm install` to get all the dependencies. 

Community Toolbox is built using a Grunt task from the source files in `/src/`, and the compiled file is saved to `/dist/community-toolbox.js`. To build, run `grunt build`. To watch files for changes, and build whenever they occur, run `grunt`. 

API calls are based on: https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-api-simple


## Testing

(testing is not yet implemented, but when it is, it'll probably work like this)

Assuming `tape` is installed via `npm install`:

`npm test`
